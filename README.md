Problem Statement

Lately, Atliq Grands team have observed a decrease in both market share and revenue within the luxury and business hotels sector, attributed to changes in competition and management strategies. To reverse this trend, the managing director has decided to use "Business and Data Intelligence" strategies.

However, AtliQ lacks an internal team capable of analyzing their data for insights. Therefore, their revenue management team is considering hiring an external service provider to extract valuable insights from their historical data.

Objective

The goal is to figure out why and where there's been a drop in market share and revenue for the Atliq hotel chain. We'll delve into data to uncover insights into what's behind the decline and devise strategies to reverse the trend.

Project Steps

Data Understanding & exploration Data Cleaning Data Transformation Insights Generation

Data Understanding & exploration

In Datasets we received 5 csv files dim_date.csv: Contains Date, month& year, week no., type of day (weekend or weekday) dim_hotels.csv: Contains hotel category a further subcategory in different cities dim_rooms.csv: Contains room class fact_aggregated_bookings.csv: contains successful bookings against capacity
fact_bookings.csv: contains overall bookings

Data Cleaning

Invalid guest records with negative values were removed, ensuring data accuracy and removing potential errors. Remove outliers from revenue generated and revenue realized columns with functions such as mean and std deviation.

Data Transformation

Data Calculation: A new column has been added to derive occupancy percentage. Occupancy percentage is a key performance indicator in Hospitality domain. It reflects the utilization of hotel assets(rooms) aiding in strategic decisions such as Strategic pricing, Offers and resource optimization. Data merging: Merged data from different datasets to create comprehensive view of hotel performance

Create occupancy percentage column df_agg_bookings['occ_pct'] = df_agg_bookings.apply(lambda row: row['successful_bookings']/row['capacity'], axis=1)
Convert it to a percentage value df_agg_bookings['occ_pct'] = df_agg_bookings['occ_pct'].apply(lambda x: round(x*100, 2)) df_agg_bookings.head(3)

Insights

What is an average occupancy rate in each of the room categories?

Step 1 merge table df_agg_bookings & df_rooms

df = pd.merge(df_agg_bookings, df_rooms, left_on="room_category", right_on="room_id") df.head(4)

Step 2 df.groupby("room_class")["occ_pct"].mean()

Output : room_class Elite 58.009756 Premium 58.028213 Presidential 59.277925 Standard 57.889643

Print average occupancy rate per city
df.groupby("city")["occ_pct"].mean()

output: city Bangalore 56.332376 Delhi 61.507341 Hyderabad 58.120652 Mumbai 57.909181

When was the occupancy better? Weekday or Weekend?
Step 1 : Merge 2 tables first df & df_date on date & check_in_date

Step 2 : df.groupby("day_type")["occ_pct"].mean().round(2)

Output: day_type weekeday 50.88 weekend 72.34

4: In the month of June, what is the occupancy for different cities

df_june_22.groupby('city')['occ_pct'].mean().round(2).sort_values(ascending=False)

output city Delhi 62.47 Hyderabad 58.46 Mumbai 58.38 Bangalore 56.44

5: We got new data for the month of august. Append that to existing data

latest_df = pd.concat([df, df_august], ignore_index = True, axis = 0) latest_df.tail(10)

6: Print revenue realized per city
df_bookings_all.groupby("city")["revenue_realized"].sum()

Output: city Bangalore 420383550 Delhi 294404488 Hyderabad 325179310 Mumbai 668569251

7: Print month by month revenue
df_bookings_all.groupby("mmm yy")["revenue_realized"].sum()

Output: mmm yy Jul 22 389940912 Jun 22 377191229 May 22 408375641
